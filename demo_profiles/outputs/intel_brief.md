## Executive Summary (BLUF)

High-confidence intelligence indicates a **LockBit ransomware intrusion** that progressed through a **multi-stage, ~11-day lifecycle**, culminating in ransomware deployment and data encryption across accessible Windows hosts.

The activity demonstrates **deliberate operational discipline**, including resilient command-and-control (C2), credential theft, lateral movement, and staged exfiltration prior to impact. The tradecraft observed aligns with **established LockBit affiliate behavior** and reflects a campaign optimized for **persistence, redundancy, and recovery from partial defensive disruption**.

This intrusion pattern presents a **high operational risk** to enterprise environments and warrants immediate threat hunting, validation, and detection hardening.

---

## Threat Background & Context

LockBit remains one of the most active and operationally mature ransomware ecosystems, operating through a **ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)** model that enables affiliates to rapidly adapt tooling and infrastructure.

The activity observed in this case reflects:

* Modular tooling and fallback mechanisms
* Emphasis on credential access and lateral movement before encryption
* Delayed execution to evade early detection and maximize blast radius

Rather than relying on a single exploit or execution path, the actor leveraged **layered techniques**, allowing the intrusion to survive partial containment or missed detections.

---

## Intrusion Lifecycle Overview

Analysis indicates the intrusion unfolded across the following stages:

1. **Initial Access**
   Entry was achieved through a **trojanized installer**, consistent with user-assisted execution and masquerading techniques.

2. **Command & Control Establishment**
   The actor established **HTTPS-based C2 channels**, blending malicious traffic with legitimate web traffic to reduce visibility.

3. **Credential Access**
   Credential material was harvested via **LSASS memory access**, enabling privilege escalation and lateral access.

4. **Lateral Movement**
   The actor expanded access across the environment using:

   * SMB (Admin Shares)
   * RDP
   * WinRM

5. **Data Exfiltration**
   Prior to ransomware deployment, data was staged and exfiltrated using:

   * MEGA cloud storage
   * FTP services
   * Anonymous file-sharing infrastructure

6. **Ransomware Deployment**
   Automated execution encrypted accessible Windows hosts, consistent with LockBit deployment playbooks.

**Time to Impact:** ~11 days (≈239 hours)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Initiate targeted threat hunts** focused on credential access, lateral movement, and C2 behaviors
2. **Validate scope of exposure** beyond initially identified systems
3. **Promote confirmed behaviors** into Findings and Detection Strategy development
4. **Harden detections** against masquerading installers, LSASS access, and pre-impact staging activity
