Perfect. This is the **right sequence**, and doing it now will save you from re-litigating branding six months from now.

Below is a **clean, production-ready package** covering all three asks. This is written the way a real product team would lock it in.

# SPARK — Branding Lock-In (v1)

## 1️⃣ Tertiary UI Icon (FINALIZED)

### Purpose

The tertiary icon exists **only** to support usability.
It is not expressive. It is not decorative. It must survive extreme scaling.

---

### ✅ Final Tertiary Icon Definition

**Form**

* Shield outline only
* Vertically split down the center
* No binary
* No gradients
* No text
* No knight
* Flat geometry

**Visual Characteristics**

* Symmetrical
* Medium stroke weight
* Rounded corners (subtle, not soft)
* Works at **16px, 24px, 32px**

**Color Rules**

* Default: `--spark-purple-500`
* Dark mode: `--spark-purple-400`
* Disabled / inactive: `--spark-gray-500`
* Must work in **single-color monochrome**

**Where it is used**

* Top-left app navigation
* Sidebar (expanded + collapsed)
* Browser tab / favicon
* App icon
* Buttons / badges
* Loading indicators (optional)

**Hard rule**

> If detail is visible only above 32px, it does not belong in the tertiary icon.

This icon should feel *inevitable*, not noticeable.

---

## 2️⃣ UI Color Tokens (Exact, Not Vibes)

This is the most important section.
These are **tokens**, not raw colors. Tokens prevent drift.

---

### 🎨 Core Brand Tokens

```text
--spark-purple-600  # Brand anchor (logos, key accents)
--spark-purple-500  # Primary UI accent
--spark-purple-400  # Hover / active states
--spark-purple-300  # Subtle highlights
```

**Usage**

* Active tab indicator
* Selected list items
* Primary buttons
* Focus states

---

### 🔵 Stability / Informational

```text
--spark-blue-600
--spark-blue-500
--spark-blue-400
```

**Usage**

* Informational messages
* Neutral confirmations
* Secondary emphasis

---

### 🔴 Risk / Adversary Signal (Use Sparingly)

```text
--spark-red-600
--spark-red-500
--spark-red-400
```

**Usage**

* Validation failures
* High-risk findings
* Adversary indicators

**Rule**

> Red is a signal, not decoration.

---

### ⚫ Neutral Foundation (80–90% of UI)

```text
--spark-gray-900  # Background (dark mode)
--spark-gray-800
--spark-gray-700
--spark-gray-600
--spark-gray-500
--spark-gray-400
--spark-gray-300
--spark-gray-200
```

**Usage**

* Layout
* Text
* Dividers
* Panels

If the UI looks “colorful,” you’ve already overused color.

---

### 🟢 Validation / Success

```text
--spark-green-600
--spark-green-500
--spark-green-400
```

**Usage**

* Passed validation
* Completed workflows
* Confirmed results

---

### UI Color Rules (Non-Negotiable)

* Purple = **identity**
* Blue = **stability**
* Red = **risk**
* Green = **success**
* Gray = **everything else**

> If you can’t explain *why* a color is used, it shouldn’t be.

---

## 3️⃣ SPARK Brand Usage Contract (1-Page, Lock This In)

This is your future-proofing document.

---

## SPARK — Brand & Visual Usage Contract

### Brand Position

SPARK is an **analyst-driven security platform** that prioritizes clarity, control, and evidence-based decision making. AI augments the analyst; it does not replace them.

---

### Visual Principles

1. **Clarity over expression**
2. **Structure over novelty**
3. **Restraint over decoration**
4. **Consistency over creativity**
5. **Timelessness over trends**

---

### Logo Usage Rules

* **Primary logo**

  * Used only for brand identity
  * Never embedded in UI workflows

* **Secondary logo**

  * Used for product representation
  * Allowed on splash screens, reports, docs

* **Tertiary icon**

  * Used everywhere in UI
  * No substitutions allowed

---

### Color Usage Rules

* Brand colors are accents, not backgrounds
* Red indicates risk, never style
* Purple indicates identity, not decoration
* Neutral tones dominate the interface

---

### Imagery Rules

**Allowed**

* Diagrams
* Structured flows
* Minimal icons
* Annotated UI screenshots

**Not allowed**

* Hacker stock photos
* Flames, sparks, lightning
* AI brains, robots, humanoids
* Masks, hoodies, skulls
* Trend-driven visuals

---

### AI Representation Rule

AI must always be shown as:

* Assistive
* Suggestive
* Reviewable
* Human-controlled

Never autonomous. Never dominant.

---

### Drift Prevention Rule

If a visual asset:

* Adds noise
* Obscures meaning
* Competes with data
* Feels trendy

It does not ship.

---

## Final Status

✔️ Tertiary UI icon finalized
✔️ UI color tokens locked
✔️ Brand usage contract defined

You now have **branding guardrails**, not just branding assets.

---

### Next (Optional, but Logical)

If you want to fully operationalize this, next steps would be:

* Apply tokens directly into your Streamlit theme
* Create SVG exports for all three logos
* Add this contract as `docs/branding.md`
* Audit existing UI screens against these rules

Just tell me which one you want to execute next, and we’ll do it cleanly and once.

Done — I exported **all three logos as SVGs**:

* [Download the Primary Logo SVG](sandbox:/mnt/data/spark_logo_primary.svg)
* [Download the Secondary Logo SVG](sandbox:/mnt/data/spark_logo_secondary.svg)
* [Download the Tertiary UI Icon SVG](sandbox:/mnt/data/spark_logo_tertiary_icon.svg)

Notes (quick + important):

* **Primary + Secondary SVGs** are “SVG wrappers” embedding your current PNG artwork (so they’ll drop into web/UI pipelines cleanly as `.svg`).
* **Tertiary icon** is a **true vector SVG** (monochrome-friendly, scales cleanly, uses `currentColor` so it’s easy to theme in UI).
