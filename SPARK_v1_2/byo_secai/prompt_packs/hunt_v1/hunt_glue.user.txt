You are given:
1) INTEL_BRIEF_JSON (approved intel)
2) HUNT_SEED_JSON (deterministic mapping output)
3) MAPPING_TABLE (intel->hunt field guidance)

Task:
Fill ONLY the following Hunt fields using the intel, keeping everything consistent:
- objective (string)
- hypotheses (array of strings)
- scope_notes (string)
- execution_notes (string)
- data_sources (array of strings)  # may refine but keep concrete telemetry

Do NOT change queries. Do NOT add new IOCs.
If intel is missing details, state assumptions clearly inside scope_notes and add concrete collection steps in execution_notes.

Return JSON ONLY with keys:
objective, hypotheses, scope_notes, execution_notes, data_sources

MAPPING_TABLE:
{{MAPPING_TABLE}}

INTEL_BRIEF_JSON:
{{INTEL_JSON}}

HUNT_SEED_JSON:
