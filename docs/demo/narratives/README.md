# Narrative Demo Reports

This directory contains narrative-style demo reports used for presentations,
walkthroughs, and storytelling.

These reports are **not formal SPARK artifacts**.
They exist to show how structured SPARK outputs may be summarized or
communicated to stakeholders after analysis is complete.

They should not be used as reference implementations for SPARK workflows.
