# Threat Hunt Package – LockBit Ransomware

**Linked Intel:** intel_8d33dc54ee

## 1. Threat Overview

LockBit ransomware was deployed after an eleven-day dwell period, with the threat actor maintaining multiple fallback mechanisms for persistence, access, and data theft. The intrusion lifecycle included:

- Initial access via a trojanized installer
- Establishment of resilient command-and-control over HTTPS
- Credential theft using LSASS dumping
- Lateral movement via SMB, RDP, and WinRM
- Data exfiltration using anonymous file-sharing services, cloud storage (MEGA), and FTP

**Why it matters:**  
The threat actor executed a coordinated ransomware deployment, resulting in the encryption of accessible Windows hosts. The deployment was automated with multiple fallback scripts to ensure completion despite partial failures.

**Time to Ransomware:** ~11 days (239 hours)

## 2. Objective

Determine whether there is evidence of LockBit ransomware deployment in a Windows enterprise environment following an eleven-day intrusion lifecycle and confirm the presence of suspicious activity.

### Hypotheses

- If **T1003.001 (LSASS Memory)** is present, telemetry consistent with credential access should be observed.
- If **T1021.001 (RDP)** is present, remote service execution should be observed.
- If **T1021.002 (SMB / Admin Shares)** is present, lateral movement via file shares should be observed.

## 4. High-Fidelity Indicators & Hunt Queries

### IOC — SHA256 Hashes

```crowdstrike
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| in(field=SHA256HashData, values=[...])
| groupBy([@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, FileName, FilePath, ImageFileName,
           CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName, ParentCommandLine, SHA256HashData],
          limit=20000)
IOC — File Names
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| in(field=FileName, values=['check.exe','ds.exe','setup_wm.exe',
                             'svchosts.exe','svcmc.dll','svcmcc.dll'])
| groupBy([...], limit=20000)
IOC — Network Connections (IP:Port)
#event_simpleName=NetworkConnectIP4
((RemoteAddressIP4="159.100.14.254" and RPort=443) OR ...)
| groupBy([...], limit=20000)
Behavioral Correlation — Process ↔ DNS
(#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2 OR #event_simpleName=DnsRequest) event_platform=Win
| case{
    TargetProcessId="*" | falconPID:=TargetProcessId;
    ContextProcessId="*" | falconPID:=ContextProcessId;
}
| selfJoinFilter([aid, falconPID], ...)
5. Findings
5.1 Summary
No findings recorded yet. Execute a Run to generate Findings.

Pending execution.

6. Analyst Guidance
Use Section 4 queries to validate hypotheses.
Escalate confirmed malicious activity into Findings and promote validated behaviors into an ADS.

7. Reporting Summary
Threat: LockBit Ransomware
Status: Draft
Next Step: Execute hunt queries and record findings
