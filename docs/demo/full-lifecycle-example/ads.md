**ID:** ads_490170046f  
**Linked Finding:** finding_bce0b55f5d_1  

---

## Goal

Detect recurrence of LockBit ransomware tradecraft prior to encryption impact.

---

## Categorization

**Tactics**
- Credential Access
- Lateral Movement
- Defense Evasion
- Execution

**Techniques**
- T1003.001 – LSASS Memory
- T1055 – Process Injection
- T1036.005 – Masquerading
- T1053.005 – Scheduled Task
- T1021.001 – RDP
- T1021.002 – SMB / Admin Shares

---

## Strategy Abstract

Correlate high-confidence process execution signals with DNS and outbound network telemetry to attribute command-and-control and ransomware staging behavior to specific process contexts.

Escalate when:
- Execution originates from user-writable paths
- Unsigned or masqueraded binaries are observed
- Process lineage indicates hands-on-keyboard activity
- Network destinations align with known proxy or C2 infrastructure

---

## Telemetry Requirements

- `ProcessRollup2`
- `NetworkConnectIP4`
- `DnsRequest`
- SHA256 file hashes
- Parent/child process context

---

## Blind Spots

- Missing or tampered EDR telemetry
- Heavily obfuscated or fileless techniques
- Novel tooling without observable process artifacts

---

## False Positives

Possible from:
- Internal admin tools
- Red team activity
- Unsigned enterprise utilities

Mitigate using signer, path, and parent-process allowlists.

---

## Validation

- Test using safe ransomware simulations
- Confirm telemetry joins and attribution logic
- Tune against benign enterprise activity

---

## Response

- Deploy initially as hunt logic
- Promote to alerting detection once tuned
- Escalate confirmed activity to Incident Response
