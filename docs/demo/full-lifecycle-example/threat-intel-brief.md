# Threat Intel Brief: LockBit Ransomware
**ID:** intel_8d33dc54ee  
**Status:** Approved  
**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Author:** Threat Hunting / CTI

## BLUF
High-confidence intelligence indicates LockBit ransomware deployment following an ~11-day intrusion lifecycle with multiple fallback mechanisms for persistence and data theft.

## Background
The actor demonstrated strong operational discipline, maintaining covert access despite partial endpoint defense blocks. Activity progressed from initial access to C2, credential theft, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment.

## Threat Description
- Initial access via trojanized installer  
- HTTPS-based resilient C2  
- Credential theft via LSASS dumping  
- Lateral movement over SMB/RDP/WinRM  
- Exfiltration via MEGA, FTP, and anonymous file-sharing

## Evidence & Indicators
**Domains:** accessservicesonline[.]com, compdatasystems[.]com, retailadvertisingservices[.]com  
**IPs:** 31.172.83.162:443, 159.100.14.254:443, 185.236.232.20:445, 38.180.61.247:30001  
**SHA256:** d8b2d883d3b3..., ced4ee8a9814..., 44cf04192384..., b4ad5df385ee..., 3f97e112f0c5..., 59c9d10f06f8...

## Impact
Automated ransomware deployment encrypted accessible Windows hosts.  
**Time to Ransomware:** ~11 days

## MITRE ATT&CK (Selected)
T1036.005, T1055, T1003.001, T1053.005, T1090, T1021.001, T1021.002, T1048, T1486

**Linked Intel:** intel_8d33dc54ee  
**Status:** Draft

## Objective
Determine whether LockBit ransomware activity is present by validating behaviors across process and network telemetry.

## Hypotheses
- If T1003.001 is present, LSASS-related execution will be observed.
- If T1021.001/002 is present, SMB/RDP lateral movement will be observed.

## Scope
**In-Scope:** Windows endpoints monitored by EDR (Process + Network telemetry)  
**Time Window:** Last 30 days

## High-Fidelity Queries
- IOC: SHA256 process executions  
- IOC: File name matches  
- IOC: IP:Port connections  
- Behavior: Process ↔ DNS correlation  
- Behavior: Process ↔ Network correlation

## Execution
Execute queries manually; review results; document Findings.

**Date:** 2026-01-27  
**Org:** Aurora Financial Services (Demo)

## BLUF
One true-positive finding confirms LockBit ransomware activity consistent with an 11-day intrusion lifecycle.

## Summary
Telemetry confirms malicious execution, credential access, lateral movement, and staging prior to ransomware deployment.

## Findings
### Confirmed Malicious Execution Pattern
- Evidence: Known malicious hashes and C2 connectivity
- Severity: Medium | Confidence: High

## Risk
High risk due to ransomware encryption and data exfiltration.

## Actions Taken
- Manual hunt execution
- Scope validation
- Escalation to IR

**Linked Finding:** finding_bce0b55f5d_1

## Goal
Detect recurrence of LockBit ransomware behaviors prior to encryption impact.

## Techniques
T1003.001, T1055, T1036.005, T1053.005, T1021.001, T1021.002

## Strategy
Correlate high-signal process executions with DNS and outbound network activity; escalate on masquerading, unsigned binaries, and user-writable paths.

## Telemetry
ProcessRollup2, NetworkConnectIP4, DnsRequest, SHA256

## Response
Pilot as hunt → promote to alert after tuning.
